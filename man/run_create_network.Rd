\title{Create Correlation Network from Feature Data}
\usage{
run_create_network(
  expomicset,
  feature_type = c("degs", "omics", "factors", "factor_features", "exposures",
    "degs_feature_cor", "omics_feature_cor", "factor_features_feature_cor"),
  action = c("add", "get")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object containing correlation results in metadata.}

\item{feature_type}{Type of correlation result to convert to a network. One of:
\code{"degs"}, \code{"omics"}, \code{"factors"}, \code{"factor_features"}, \code{"exposures"},
\code{"degs_feature_cor"}, \code{"omics_feature_cor"}, or \code{"factor_features_feature_cor"}.}

\item{action}{Whether to \code{"add"} the network to the object or \code{"get"} it as a list.}
}
\value{
If \code{action = "add"}, returns the updated \code{MultiAssayExperiment} with a new \code{network} entry in metadata.
If \code{action = "get"}, returns a list with \code{graph} (an \code{igraph} object) and \code{summary} (a tibble).
}
\description{
Constructs an undirected feature–feature or feature–exposure correlation network
from correlation results stored in a \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object. The function
supports multiple correlation formats depending on \code{feature_type}, and stores or returns
an \code{igraph} object with associated node and edge metadata.
}
\details{
The function detects the appropriate edge and node structure based on column names
in the correlation results. Edge weights are based on correlation coefficients and include FDR values.
