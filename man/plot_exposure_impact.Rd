\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object containing the output
from \code{\link{run_exposure_impact}} in its metadata.}

\item{min_per_group}{Integer. Minimum number of features required for an
exposure group to be included in the boxplot. Default is \code{5}.}

\item{facet_cols}{Optional vector of colors for the exposure category facets.
If \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{ggsci::pal_jco()} colors.}

\item{bar_cols}{Optional vector of colors for the bar plot groups. If \code{NULL},
defaults to \code{ggsci::pal_uchicago()} colors.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Transparency of facet background fill.
Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns in the combined patchwork layout.
Default is \code{2}.}

\item{nrow}{Integer. Number of rows in the combined patchwork layout.
Default is \code{1}.}

\item{heights}{Numeric vector. Relative heights of the patchwork panels.
Default is \code{c(1, 1)}.}

\item{widths}{Numeric vector. Relative widths of the patchwork panels.
Default is \code{c(2, 1)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object composed with \code{patchwork} that includes:
\enumerate{
\item A boxplot of degree centrality values for features associated with each exposure.
\item A barplot showing the number of DEGs associated and not associated with exposures.
}
}
\description{
This function generates a two-panel visualization of the results from
\code{\link{run_exposure_impact}}. It displays (1) the degree centrality
of features associated with each exposure as a boxplot, and (2) a stacked
bar plot summarizing how many differentially expressed features are associated
with exposures.
}
\details{
This function assumes that \code{\link{run_exposure_impact}} has already been run and that
the resulting exposure impact metrics are stored in the \code{metadata(expomicset)} list
under the \code{"exposure_impact"} entry.

The left panel (boxplot) stratifies centrality by exposure and facet category.
The right panel (barplot) summarizes the total and associated DEG counts.
