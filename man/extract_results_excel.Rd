\title{Export tidyexposomics Results to Excel}
\usage{
extract_results_excel(
  expomicset,
  file = "tidyexposomics_results.xlsx",
  result_types = c("correlation", "association", "differential_analysis",
    "multiomics_integration", "network", "enrichment", "exposure_summary", "pipeline"),
  include_empty_tabs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object with results stored
in \verb{@metadata}, typically created by the \code{tidyexposomics} pipeline.}

\item{file}{Character. Path to the output Excel file.}

\item{result_types}{Character vector specifying which result categories
to export. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"correlation"}: Correlation results.
\item \code{"association"}: Association results.
\item \code{"differential_analysis"}: Differential abundance results,
including sensitivity analysis if available.
\item \code{"multiomics_integration"}: Common top features contributing to
latent factors from multi-omics integration.
\item \code{"network"}: Exposure impact metrics from network analyses.
\item \code{"enrichment"}: Enrichment results by omic and exposure category.
\item \code{"exposure_summary"}: Summary statistics for exposure variables.
\item \code{"pipeline"}: Overview of steps completed in the pipeline.
}

Use \code{"all"} to export all of the above categories.}

\item{include_empty_tabs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds placeholder sheets for
any missing result types. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An Excel file is written to the specified path.
A message is printed with the file location.
}
\description{
Exports selected results stored in a \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object created
by the \code{tidyexposomics} pipeline to an Excel workbook.
Users can select which result types to include,
and optionally add placeholder sheets for missing data.
