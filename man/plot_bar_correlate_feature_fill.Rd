\title{Plot Top Feature Associations Across Exposure Categories}
\usage{
plot_bar_correlate_feature_fill(expomicset, geneset = "degs", top_n = 15)
}
\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object containing exposure-feature correlation results.}

\item{geneset}{A character string indicating the type of features to use.
Options are \code{"degs"} (differentially expressed genes) or \code{"factors"} (latent factors). Default is \code{"degs"}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer specifying the number of top features to display. Default is \code{15}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying the top features and their associated exposure categories.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot visualizing the most frequently associated features
across exposure categories based on correlation results.
}
\details{
The function extracts correlation results from \code{metadata(expomicset)},
groups features by exposure category, and visualizes the number of significant associations for each feature.
The top \code{top_n} features with the highest number of associations are displayed,
with color representing different exposure categories.
