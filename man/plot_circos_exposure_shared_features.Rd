\title{Plot Circular Network of Exposures Sharing Common Features}
\usage{
plot_circos_exposure_shared_features(expomicset, geneset = "degs", cutoff = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object containing exposure-feature correlation results.}

\item{geneset}{A character string indicating the type of features to use.
Options are \code{"degs"} (differentially expressed genes) or \code{"factors"} (latent factors). Default is \code{"degs"}.}

\item{cutoff}{An integer specifying the minimum number of shared features required to display an exposure-exposure connection. Default is \code{10}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggraph} plot displaying a circular network of exposures sharing common features.
}
\description{
Generates a circular correlation network plot to visualize exposures that share a high number of associated features.
}
\details{
This function identifies exposures that share a significant number of correlated features.
It constructs a circular network visualization using \code{ggraph}, where:
\itemize{
\item Nodes represent exposures, with fill color indicating their category.
\item Edges represent the number of shared features, with thicker and more intense edges for stronger overlaps.
}

The input correlation data is extracted from \code{metadata(expomicset)}, and only exposure pairs sharing more than \code{cutoff} features are included.
