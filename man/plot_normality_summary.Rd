\title{Plot Normality Summary of Exposure Variables}
\usage{
plot_normality_summary(expomicset, transformed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expomicset}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object with quality control metadata.}

\item{transformed}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, use results after transformation. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object summarizing the number of exposures classified as normal or not normal.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot summarizing the number of exposure variables that pass or fail normality
tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk) before or after transformation.
}
\details{
This function assumes that \code{run_normality_check()} has been executed and that the results are
stored in \code{metadata(expomicset)$quality_control$normality}. If \code{transformed = TRUE}, the function will
instead plot the transformation summary stored in \code{metadata(expomicset)$quality_control$transformation$norm_summary},
which is populated by \code{transform_exposure()}.

The plot includes both bar heights and overlaid line segments to reinforce the counts.
Colors are drawn from the Lancet or UChicago palettes via \code{ggsci} and \code{ggpubr}.
