# Introduction

Exposure to environmental factors is a major determinant of health and disease. The exposome is a term that represents the totality of environmental exposures that drive disease and overall health [(Wild et al. 2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16103423/). To tackle the daunting task of characterizing the relationship between a multiplicity of exposures and disease outcomes, epidemiological studies have moved towards exposure wide association studies (ExWAS) where sets of exposures are associated with an outcome [(Chung et al. 2024)](https://academic.oup.com/exposome/article/4/1/osae001/7574628). The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled profiling of several layers of biological information. These layers too can be integrated to better understand the relationship between exposures and disease outcomes.

The `tidyexposomics` package is designed to facilitate the integration of exposure and omics data to identify exposure-omics associations. We structure our commands to fit into the `tidyverse` framework, where commands are designed to be simplified and intuitive. Here we provide functionality to perform quality control, sample and exposure association analysis, differential abundance analysis, multi-omics integration, and functional enrichment analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='tidyexposomics pipeline overview. Exposure and omics data are stored in a MultiAssayExperiment. Data then undergo quality cotnrol, sample and exposure associations, differential abundance analysis, multi-omics integration, and functional enrichment analysis. The pipeline is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing users to customize their analysis.',}

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install the current development version
devtools::install_github("BioNomad/tidyexposomics")
```


# Loading Data

To get started we need to load the data. The `expOmicSet` function is used to create a MultiAssayExperiment object that contains the exposure and omics data. As a quick introduction, a MultiAssayExperiment object is a container for storing multiple assays (e.g., omics data) and their associated metadata:


```{r xxx, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE,out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Overview of the MultiAssayExperiment Object Structure. Subject level data is captured within the `colData` of the MultiAssayExperiment. Observations are stored within `experiments` slots in the MultiAssayExperiment and `sampleMap` is used to link the data ( [MultiAssay Special Interest Group 2024](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/MultiAssayExperiment/inst/doc/MultiAssayExperiment.html) ).'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/mae.png")
```

We use the MultiAssayExperiment object to store the exposure and omics data. The `expOmicSet` function takes several arguments:

- The `var_info` argument is a data frame that contains information about the variables in the exposure meta data. 
- The `exposure` argument is a data frame that contains the exposure data, 
- The `omics` argument is a list of data frames that contain the omics data. 
- The `row_data` argument is a list of data frames that contain information about the rows of each omics data frame.


```{r,eval=FALSE}

# Create list of omics data frames
omics_list <- list(
  "CD16+ Monocyte RNA" = cd16_rna,
  "CD4+ T-cell RNA" = cd4_rna,
  "CD4+ T-cell miRNA"= cd4_mirna,
  "CD16+ Monocyte miRNA" = cd16_mirna,
  "Serum Proteomics" = prot_abd_unnorm,
  "Serum Adductomics" = adduct
)

# Create list of omics row data data frames
fdata <- list(
  "CD16+ Monocyte RNA" = cd16_rna_fdata,
  "CD4+ T-cell RNA" = cd4_rna_fdata,
  "CD4+ T-cell miRNA"= cd4_mirna_fdata,
  "CD16+ Monocyte miRNA" = cd16_mirna_fdata,
  "Serum Proteomics" = prot_fdata,
  "Serum Adductomics" = adduct_fdata
)

# Create the expOmicSet object
expom <- expOmicSet(
  var_info = des,
  exposure = aw_dataset_cv2_filt,
  omics = omics_list,
  row_data = fdata)
```

# Quality Control

## Missingness

Oftentimes when collecting data, there are missing values. The `filter_missing` function is used to filter out variables with too many missing values. The `na_thresh` argument is used to set the threshold for missing values. For example, if `na_thresh = 20`, then any variable with more than 20% missing values will be removed.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
expom_qc <- expom |> 
  # Filter out variables with too many missing values
  filter_missing(na_thresh = 20)
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,out.width="80%"}
# Check the number of missing values
expom_qc |> 
  plot_missing_summary(threshold = 20)
```

Here we see that the Serum Adducts have the highest number of missing values, followed by the exposure data.

## Imputation

Now that we have filtered out the variables with too many missing values, we can impute the missing values. The `impute_missing` function is used to impute missing values.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Impute missing values
expom_qc <- expom_qc |> 
  impute_missing(
    exposure_impute_method = "median",
    omics_impute_method = "median")
```

## PCA Analysis

To identify the spread of the data, we can perform a principal component analysis (PCA). The `pca_analysis` function is used to perform PCA on samples with observations in each omics data frame. The `plot_pca` function is used to plot the PCA results. We automatically identify sample outliers based on the Mahalanobis distance, a measure of the distance between a point and a distribution. 


```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Perform PCA analysis
expom_qc <- expom_qc |> 
  
  # Principal component analysis
  pca_analysis() 
```


```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
# Plot PCA analysis
expom_qc |> 
  plot_pca()
```

Here we see have two sample outliers, and that most variation is captured in the first two principal components for both features and samples.

## Normality Check

When determining variable associations it is important to check the normality of the data. The `check_normality` function is used to check the normality of the data. The `transform_exposure` function is used to transform the data to make it more normal. Here the `transform_method` is set to `best` as it will compare the normality of the data before and after transformation and select the best method. The `transform_method` can be set to `log2`, `sqrt`, or `x_1_3`. 


```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Check Variable Normality
expom_qc <- expom_qc |> 
  # Check Variable Normality
  check_normality() |> 
  
  # Transform Variables 
  transform_exposure(transform_method = "best") 
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# expom_qc |> 
#   plot_normality_sum()
```

# Sample-Exposure Association

## Sample Clustering

The `cluster_samples` function is used to cluster samples based on the exposure data. The `clustering_approach` argument is used to set the clustering approach. The `clustering_approach` can be set to `diana`, `gap`, or `elbow`. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Sample Clustering
expom_sample_exp <- expom_qc |> 
  cluster_samples(exposure_cols = exp_vars,
                  clustering_approach = "diana")
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Plot Sample Clusters
expom_sample_exp |> 
  plot_sample_clusters(
    cols_of_interest = c(exp_vars,"age","pftfev1fvc_actual")) 
```

Here we see two clusters, largely driven by levels of Immunoglobulin E.

## Exposure Correlation

We can also correlate exposures with each other. The `plot_exposure_corr` function is used to plot the correlation between exposures. 

```{r}

```


## ExWAS Association

The `perform_exwas` function is used to perform ExWAS analysis. The `outcome` argument is used to set the outcome variable. The `exposures` argument is used to set the exposures of interest. The `covariates` argument is used to set the covariates to adjust for.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Perform ExWAS Analysis
expom_sample_exp <- expom_sample_exp |> 
  perform_exwas(
    outcome = "pftfev1fvc_actual",
    exposures = all_vars[
      !all_vars %in% c("pftfev1fvc_actual",
                       "age",
                       "sex",
                       "race")],
    covariates = c("age","sex","race")) 
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
expom_sample_exp |> 
  plot_exp_outcome_association()
```

Here we see that PM10/PM2.5 exposure, and eosinophil levels are associated with FEV1/FVC after adjusting for age, sex, and race.

# Differential Abundance

## Differential Abundance

We also provide functionality to test for differentially abundant features associated with a particular outcome across several omics layers. Using a volcano plot, we can visualize the results of the differential abundance analysis.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Run differential abundance analysis
expom_da <- expom_sample_exp |> 
  run_differential_abundance(
    formula = ~ pftfev1fvc_actual + age + sex + race,
    method = "limma_voom",
    contrasts = c("pftfev1fvc_actual - (Intercept)"),
    minimum_counts = 1,
    minimum_proportion = 0.1,
    scaling_method = "none")
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
expom_da |> 
  plot_volcano()
```

We note that CD4+ T-cell RNA has the greatest number of differentially abundant features, followed by CD16+ monocyte RNA, serum proteomics, then CD16+ monocyte miRNA, CD4+ T-cell miRNA and serum adductomics.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Depending on pre-processing steps, the results of the differential abundance analysis may vary. The `sensitivity_analysis` function is used to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the results. Here we determine if a feature is still differentially abundant if different minimum values, proportions, scaling methods are used, and the inclusion of covariates.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Perform Sensitivity Analysis
expom_da <- expom_da |> 
  run_sensitivity_analysis(
    base_formula = ~ pftfev1fvc_actual + age + sex + race, 
    contrasts = c("pftfev1fvc_actual - (Intercept)"),
    methods = c("limma_voom"),
    scaling_methods = c("none"),
    min_counts_range = c(1,5),
    min_proportion_range = c(0.1,0.3),
    covariates_to_remove = c("age" , "sex" , "race")) 
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
expom_da |> 
  plot_sensitivity_summary()

```

We note that transcriptomic assays have the greatest number of differentially abundant features and higher stability scores, here the sum of the number of times the feature was differentially abundant under different conditions

# Multi-Omics Integration

We also provide mul. The `integrate_multiomics` function is used to integrate the different omics layers. The `method` argument is used to set the method of integration. The `method` can be set to `union`, `intersection`, or `mean`.
